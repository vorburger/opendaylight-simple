# opendaylight-simple

This project let you run a typical OpenDaylight SDN application such as _CoE_ or _netvirt_ without requiring the Apache Karaf OSGi runtime container.

[See this presentation given in 2018.09 at the ODL DDF during ONS Europe in Amsterdam](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14TM9oCn0nLo7RJAhAHglXM4P6oTxsVjJBfFE1wl1qJc) for some background.

In July 2020, it was Archived here on GitHub (and in the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/faq/), LOL),
but it now lives on at the [linuxfoundation.org](https://www.linuxfoundation.org) hosted [git.opendaylight.org](https://git.opendaylight.org)
in the [odl-micro](https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=odlmicro.git;a=shortlog) repository!

The code in the _odl-micro_ repositority was originally imported from this repository.  The git history was fully preserved
for appropriate attribution.  The [ARCHIVE branch](https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-simple/tree/ARCHIVE) reflects
the exact state before the move; including the original README etc.  (The [issue-102_Signed-off-by](https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-simple/tree/issue-102_Signed-off-by)
branch reflects the exact commit as imported into _odl-micro_ on _git.opendaylight.org_; see
[issue #102](https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-simple/issues/102) for full background.)

Please contact [OpenDaylight.org](https://www.opendaylight.org)'s active developers via
