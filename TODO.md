- [ ] https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-simple/issues/37 including:
- [ ] why does maven-assembly-plugin dependencySet attempt to download from so many other Maven repos than only nexus.opendaylight.org
- [ ] why does maven-assembly-plugin dependencySet attempt to download so many additional unsed dependencies, like Maven plugins's
- [ ] why does maven-assembly-plugin dependencySet attempt to constantly re-download all SNAPSHOT unless we use -nsu -o
- [ ] MINOR: why does "java -jar lib/ch.vorburger.opendaylight.simple.poc-1.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" not work?  (MANIFEST.MF has all lib/*)

- [ ] create a Binding Generator? (reflecting upon annotated classes)
- [ ] [re-implement ClassPathScanner](https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-simple/pull/18#issuecomment-426859615) using [ClassGraph](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph) used in [INFRAUTILS-52](https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/INFRAUTILS-52) (and rename it to something more appropriate)
